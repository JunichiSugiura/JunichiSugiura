Once you have them with you please do the following steps:  
  
In order to pair your device via our fallback process, begin by logging in to your N26 app with your email address & password, and request an SMS login confirmation code.  
  
When the app is asking for the code, it should list your phone number at the top with some *** covering part of your number, at the bottom of this screen please tap “This phone number is not correct”. Please tap this even if your phone number is correct, this is simply the way to enter the fallback process to pair without SMS or confirmation PIN.  
  
You will need:  
• Access to your registered email address. We'll send you a link, you must be able to open this link from the same device as your phone number  
• Within the app, you will need to take a photo and short video to upload to us  
• If you've opened your account in Germany, or your ID document is only supported via video verification, you will also need to take a photo of your ID document. You can check the required form of verification for your ID via the lists on this page: [https://support.n26.com/en-eu/account-and-personal-details/verifying-my-identity/how-to-prove-my-identity](https://support.n26.com/en-eu/account-and-personal-details/verifying-my-identity/how-to-prove-my-identity)  
  
Once the pairing is submitted you should receive the result within 20 minutes during business hours. If you submit outside business hours, then it can take up to 12 hours to receive the result.
